# Karl Ardour MIDI Definition Files

## 🎬 Introduction:

---

Presented here are 202 additional files that are not currently included in Ardour. 
Created with a TCL script converting Cakewalk .ins instrument definition files to .midnam format.  Obviously it is impossible to go out and buy 200 keyboards to test these so hopefully those of you with some of these devices can test and report back. Please provide feedback on what does and does not work to:
**k_swisher at shentel dot net** and I will attempt to make fixes.

## 🎬 Column Headings:

---

*Ardour Sees It* -  Means it shows up in Ardour's manufacturers/model list.

*Ardour Sees Patches* -  Means the patches show in the banks and listed. A few of the files you must click in the bank or patch pull down box to see the banks or patches.

*Record/Playback* - Ardour records from and plays back to the device in MIDI.

*Patch Changes* - Means changing the patch in Ardour changes the patch in the device.

## 🎬 Ardour MIDI Instrument File Format

---

I'm still learning the Ardour MIDI instrument file format.  I notice
some .midnam files have SysEx lines and other do not.  I don't know
why yet.  Some files have more than one set.  Others have patches arranged
in catagories.  Very nice but these files here are basic.  Having something
for your device that does work is better than having nothing at all. I
would add as much as I can to these files after I learn what and how to do
it.  Could even add more files to this. Please forward any new featurers
you add back to me.

I have since added controller and SysEx code that I have found for the devices.  Not every device has all of these parameters.

## 🎬 Installation 

---

Create a folder in ~/.config/ardourN called *patchfiles*. The N being the version of Ardour you are currently using. Copy these files into that newly created folder and restart Ardour or Mixbus.
